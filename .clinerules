# Project Intelligence and Learning Journal

## Project Patterns
- Modular, service-oriented architecture
- Emphasis on secure, context-aware interactions
- Flexible integration with external systems

## Development Workflow
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Strict type checking
- Comprehensive logging
- Environment-based configuration

## Authentication Approach
- Granular OAuth 2.0 token management
- Secure, minimal-scope token generation
- Robust error handling for authentication flows

## API Integration Strategies
- Implement robust error handling
- Use exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Maintain clear separation between service clients

## Natural Language Processing
- Context preservation in LLM interactions
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Intelligent intent recognition

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize API call overhead
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Optimize LLM interaction latency

## Security Principles
- Never log sensitive information
- Use environment-based secret management
- Implement token rotation strategies

## Extensibility Guidelines
- Design service clients with clear interfaces
- Create abstract base classes for service interactions
- Support plugin-based architecture for future integrations

## Monitoring and Observability
- Implement structured logging
- Track API call metrics
- Create health check mechanisms
- Design for easy debugging and tracing

## Learning and Adaptation
- Continuously refine LLM interaction patterns
- Adapt to changing API capabilities
- Maintain flexibility in design approach
